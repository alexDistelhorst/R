This question involves the use of simple linear regression on the Auto data set.
library(ISLR)
attach(Auto)

(a) Use the lm() function to perform a simple linear regression with mpg as the response and horsepower as
the predictor. Use the summary() function to print the results. Comment on the output. For example:

mpg.fit=lm(mpg~horsepower)
summary(mpg.fit)

iv. What is the predicted mpg associated with a horsepower of 98? What are the associated 95% confidence
and prediction intervals?
predict(mpg.fit,data.frame(horsepower=98),interval="confidence")

predict(mpg.fit,data.frame(horsepower=98),interval="prediction")

plot(horsepower,mpg)
abline(mpg.fit)

(c) Use the plot() function to produce diagnostic plots of the least squares regression fit. Comment on any
problems you see with the fit.
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(mpg.fit)


This question involves the use of multiple linear regression on the Auto data set.
(a) Produce a scatterplot matrix which includes all of the variables in the data set.
plot(Auto)

b) Compute the matrix of correlations between the variables using the function cor(). You will need to
exclude the name variable, which is qualitative. (Hint: name is the 9th variable in Auto)
names(Auto)

cor(Auto[,-9])

c) Use the lm() function to perform a multiple linear regression with mpg as the response and all other
variables except name as the predictors. Use the summary() function to print the results.
# Origin of car (1. American, 2. European, 3. Japanese)
# Need to convert it to factor:
Auto$origin=as.factor(origin)
mpg.fit2=lm(mpg~.-name,Auto)
summary(mpg.fit2)

d) Use the plot() function to produce diagnostic plots of the linear regression fit. Comment on any
problems you see with the fit. Do the residual plots suggest any unusually large outliers? Does the
leverage plot identify any observations with unusually high leverage?
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(mpg.fit2)

e) Use the * and : symbols to fit linear regression models with interaction effects. Do any interactions
appear to be statistically significant?
mpg.fit3=lm(mpg~(displacement+horsepower+weight+year+origin)^2,Auto)
summary(mpg.fit3)

f) Try transformations of the following two variables: horsepower and weight using log(X),
âˆš
X, or X2
.
Examine the plots between the residuals and each of the two variables first before considering any
transformations.
plot(~mpg+horsepower+weight)

plot(horsepower,mpg.fit2$residuals)
